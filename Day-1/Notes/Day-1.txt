Components:
--------------
-Components are part of UI
-components are building blocks of Any React APplications
-In REact templates, app is the root component
-Components are re-usable and nested one in another
-Components can be created with an extension of *.js or *.jsx

-In React there are 2 types of components:
1.Functional Components: JavaScript
2.Class Components: ES6/ES7

Functional Components:(RFCE)
-These are simply javascript functions
-these are optionally recieve an object of properties: props
-these will return HTML components: JSX

index.js:

index.html- root

function sum(a,b)
{
	alert(a+b);
}

const sum=(a,b)=>
{
  alert(a+b);
}

2.Class Components:(RCE)
-These are ES6/ES7 classes
-class components also receive props & private internal state
-State is a private memory, which will be maintained for the components

Fn components vs Class Components:
--------------------------------------
simple functions       more feature rich
absence of 'this'      require 'this' to access class props
dumb components        stateful/smart components


JSX:
---
-It stands for JavaScript XML
-It is an extension to javascript language syntax
-It looks like XML and code for components
-JSX Tags also will support attributes similar to HTML
	<img src="" height="" width="" alt=""/>
-JSX can be transpiles/converts to pure javascript for browser understandability

Props:
------

State:
-----
-state is a internal private memory which is immutable

setState:
---------
constructor
componentdidMount
component


De-Structuring Props & State:
-----------------------------
props: 25

Event Bindings:
----------------
